## How To Add a Sticky Header to Carrd

<YouTubeEmbed url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hClMHp1CSec" label="How To Add a Sticky Header to Carrd.co" />

### 1. Set Carrd.co Page Settings

First thing you need to do is to set the vertical and horizontal padding to 0 in the page settings, in case thy are not 0 the floating navbar will not have the correct sizes and will not look good.

<Picture src={imag1} widths={[200, 400, 900]} sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" alt="Carrd page settings" />

<Button link="https:/go.bitdoze.com/carrd" text="Carrd.co" />

### 2. Get Container ID OR Add a Name to Container

In case you are not on the Pro Plus pland and you are on the standard plan you will need to get the ID of the container that is the header, to do that you need to use the inspect element in the browser as you see in the video. The ID is important as will be linked to the CSS that will make the header stickey. The vide has everything you need,

In case you are on the Pro Plus plan you can add an ID to the container and use that in you CSS code, you just go to settings and add your ID there.

### 3. CSS Code

Next thing that you need to do is to add a embed widget and add the CSS code bellow, as mentioned there will be 2 codes, one that is making the header stickey everywhere and the other that is not making the code stickey on mobile

#### Stickey On Mobile Also

```html
<style>
  #container01 {
    position: fixed !important;
    z-index: 99;
    top: 0;
  }
</style>
```

#### Stickey On Displays bigger Then 600px

```html
<style>
  @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    #container01 {
      position: fixed !important;
      z-index: 99;
      top: 0;
    }
  }
</style>
```

In the above codes you need to replace **container01** with the ID of your container from second point

### 4. Add a Space

The next container will be pushed up and the website can look bad, to fix that you can add a divider and add margins to the top of it, you can use the container bellow paddings but is better to use the devider as you can controll the mobile padding also, and in function off what you want you can play arround. All the explinations are on the video

### 5. Save the page

After you are happy with the changes you can save it and see how it looks.
